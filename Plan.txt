HTML
I think that our index.html should be the home page, 
and use pages/ for the next ones.

I've checked the <base> element to make all the html files
share the same path, so we can link to other files using the 
same paths for both index.html and pages/whatever.html
I want to ask Ruari if it is a good practice because I've never seen that.

I like the svgs, but I found that they didn't have the same width.
do you think that we should change fix that? 
I added another facebook logo that shares the width with twitter and instagram

Page design
    HOME <index.html> or <pages/home.html>
    HEADER like https://myseoulbox.com/
        

Javascript
we will probably have to implement some fancy behaviours to increase marks some ideas:
    - smooth scrolling to go top and bottom of the page or sections | instead of using <a href="to some ID">
    - the hamburger menu (for mobile design)
    - 

Use some more of the observer but also for vertical rising up of divs as seen in https://www.visitdubai.com/en/whats-on/dubai-food-festival/foodie-experiences?categoryTags=Masterclass



Phot wall widths one instagram cool instagram photos but these photos changes when you hover over them and give you an option to visit that instagram post


https://onthegrid.city			( we could use this full page grid layout for some pages with more  subcategories like the whitings to do page could be like this)

http://www.cookiesound.com ( I like their basic text font )


We could have a page with a surprise me button that picks up random things to do from he whole page ?? Bit too complicated but is it possible?






when page is belo 1300 px width we shoule make header into a hamburger menu 
and change  all the font and images sizes it different widths
