HTML
I think that our index.html should be the home page, 
and use pages/ for the next ones.

I've checked the <base> element to make all the html files
share the same path, so we can link to other files using the 
same paths for both index.html and pages/whatever.html
I want to ask Ruari if it is a good practice because I've never seen that.

I like the svgs, but I found that they didn't have the same width.
do you think that we should change fix that? 
I added another facebook logo that shares the width with twitter and instagram

Page design
    HOME <index.html> or <pages/home.html>
    HEADER like https://myseoulbox.com/
        

Javascript
we will probably have to implement some fancy behaviours to increase marks some ideas:
    - smooth scrolling to go top and bottom of the page or sections | instead of using <a href="to some ID">
    - the hamburger menu
    -
