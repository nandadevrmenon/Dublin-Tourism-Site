            <h3>Celebrate at St Patrick’s Festival</h3>
            <p>After two years on hold, St Patrick’s Festival is going to be one to remember. The National Museum of Ireland - Decorative Arts & History will be transformed into the Festival Quarter, with family activities throughout the day and gigs and parties at night. Some of Ireland’s best musicians will take to the main stage over the four nights, like Lyra, Soulé & Bobbi Arlo and Damien Dempsey, while the DJs of Mother spin. During the day, there will be a huge variety of events, from panel discussions to improv comedy shows. Head to the Spiegeltent Mór and you’ll find a series of circus and clowning shows for all ages, like Ballet Poulet and the Tumble Circus. If you fancy a bit of a jig, the giant interactive Céilí Mór will be held on 17 March led by former Riverdancer Dearbhla Lennon.</p>

            <h3>Watch Endgame at The Gate</h3>
            <p>What better way to celebrate Ireland than by taking in a play by one of our greatest writers at the Gate Theatre?
