            <h3>Canal Way Cycle Route</h3>
            <p>This 3.6km route along the Grand Canal is Dublin's main cycle artery. It links historic Portobello's Georgian past with the tech hubs of Grand Canal Dock and Spencer Dock. There's plenty of places to stop for a caffeine hit too. Try Junior's Deli &amp; Cafe on Bath Avenue. Sip a cappuccino while you chow down on a New York style Reuben or a Caesar Club sandwich. This short trip is the perfect way to kick your Dublin cycling senses into gear. </p>

            <h3>The Docklands and Ringsend</h3>
            <p>Dublin's Docklands area is an eclectic mix of old and new. Here, hip wine bars on the waterside contrast with the original village feel of Ringsend. Before setting off on your cycle, start with an Italian blend coffee and continental treat like cannoli, ricottini or croissants at il Valentino Bakery &amp; Cafe on Grand Canal Harbour. It's good fuel for the rest of your trip (and you can pick up an extra snack to take away for later).</p>

            <h3>Old town Dublin</h3>
            <p>Dublin's historic centre has so much to see and do and there is no better way to experience it than by bike. Start at the Guinness Storehouse in the Liberties, where you can hear about the area's proud brewing heritage. From here it's a short trip to the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham where over 3,500 contemporary artworks by Irish and international artists are on display. While you're in the neighbourhood, seek out Manning's Bakery on Thomas Street for a slice of rainbow cake or a coffee eclair.</p>
