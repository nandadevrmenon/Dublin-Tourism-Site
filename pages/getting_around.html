                  <p>Getting around the Dublin area is easy. Jump on our coastal train, the DART, to discover the beautiful towns and villages dotted along the coast, or use our extensive public bus network to travel the city and suburbs. There's the Luas tram system to get you out to the suburbs too as well as bicycle hire throughout the city! If you are here for a few days then the best value across bus and rail options is the Leap Visitor Card.</p>
                  
                  <p>Why not have a look at the official  <a href="https://www.transportforireland.ie" target="_blank">Transport for Ireland Journey Planner</a> to view all Dublin's transport options. It's completely free and covers bus, Luas, taxis, ferries and even walking!<p>
                      
                  <h2>Bus</h2>

                  <p>Dublin has an extensive network of public bus routes, making it super-easy to get around not just the city centre, but the inner and outer suburbs too.</p>
                  <p>First port of call is the <a href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin Bus</a> website. Its route, timetable and fare information make it easy for visitors to bus around the sights, and a real time information service shows when buses are due to arrive at stops.</p>
                    
                  <img src="images/dublin_bus.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A dublin bus fleet">
                  <p>If you are travelling to or from Dublin Airport/city centre by bus, Dublin Bus operates the following routes:<p>
                  
                  <ul>

                  </ul>                     
                    
                    
                  <h2>DoDublin Card</h2>
                    <p>If you're in Dublin for around three days, the <a href="https://dodublin.ie/dodublin-card" target="_blank"> DoDublin card</a> is a great value way to get around. The card is priced at €35 per person and gives the holder 72 hours unlimited access to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The DoDublin Hop-on Hop-off City Tour buses (with free German and Spanish tours)</li>

                  <h2>DART and rail</h2>
                  <p>The capital's iconic DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) system is a fast and frequent way of travelling in the city. The DART hugs the Irish Sea coast for much of its journey, making for one of the most scenic suburban rail routes in Europe.</p>

                   <img src="images/dart.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="A dart train">
                    
                   <p>DART is an electric rail system following the eastern coastline from Malahide and/or Howth in north Dublin, right through the city centre to southern suburbs like Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire, Dalkey and onwards to the coastal towns of Bray and Greystones in County Wicklow. 
                   </p>
                    
                  <p>Trains run regularly both on and off-peak, are kitted out with free Wi-Fi and provide one of the speediest ways to transport you around the city, not to mention the hidden beaches, seaside villages and harbour restaurants secreted away along Dublin's stunning coastline.</p>
                    
                  <p>Dublin is also a central arrival and departure point for visitors looking to explore the rest of the country by rail. Cork, Galway, Limerick, Killarney, Belfast and Sligo are just some of the intercity routes served from the city's two main stations: Heuston and Connolly.</p>

                  <h2>Luas</h2>
                  <p>Luas is Dublin's light-rail transit service - a swift, reliable (and rather lovable, if we may say so ourselves) tram system crossing the city on two lines. Tickets for Luas (the Irish word for 'speed') can be purchased at streetside vending machines. They're available for single/return journeys or as flexi-tickets covering travel for seven or 30 days. Check the destination on the front of the tram before boarding, and you're all set for a smart light-rail system serving not just stops along the River Liffey, but some of Dublin's best sights.<p>

                  <img src="images/luas.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A luas tram">
                    
                  <p>The Luas Red Line (32 stops) runs from Tallaght in the west through the city centre to Point Village, or Saggart to Connolly Station. The Green Line (35 stops) runs from Broombridge out through Ranelagh and Dundrum to Brides' Glen in the south.</p>
                    
                  <p>Highlights along the Red Line include the the 3 Arena, the National Museum of Decorative Arts & History at Collins Barracks and the historic Kilmainham Gaol; while the Green Line features the foodie village of Ranelagh, the shopping Mecca of Dundrum Town Centre, and stops a short distance from the Leopardstown racecourse.</p>
                    
                  <p>Feel free to join with the locals in calling the Luas the 'Daniel Day', 'Jerry Lee' or 'Huey Luas' - or indeed, whatever you're having yourself. It's a great way to see the city on the cheap.</p>

                  <h2>Taxi</h2>
                    Dublin taxis are plentiful and can be found at numerous ranks across the city. They can also be called for pickups. Dublin's taxi drivers often regard themselves as unofficial ambassadors to the city and can be an informal way of hearing about some of the hidden gems Dublin has to offer.

                  <h2>Bicycle and motorbike hire</h2>
                  <p>Dublin is one of the top ten bicycle-friendly cities on earth. 120km of cycle lanes, an ace <a href="http://www.dublinbikes.ie/" target="_blank">city bikes scheme</a> and a choice of cycling tours has made it easier than ever to enjoy Dublin on two wheels. <a href="http://www.dublinbikes.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin Bikes</a> are custom-designed for city cycling. If you'd prefer to hire a bike privately, there are lots of options for that too - with a range of hire companies based in the city and <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/see-do/details/phoenix-park" target="_blank">Phoenix Park</a>, and even delivering to the new mountain bike trails in the Dublin Mountains!</p>

                  <img src="images/bikes.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="dublin city bikes">
                  
                  <p>Meanwhile for dedicated motorcyclists, the freedom of a hire bike is perfect for exploring not just the city… but also the attractions on its doorstep.</p>
                  
                  <p><a href="http://www.motorental.ie/" target="_blank">Celtic Rider</a> was Ireland's first motorcycle rental company. It offers a range of world-class touring bikes with rentals including fully comprehensive insurance and unlimited mileage. It's located just 15 minutes from the airport and city centre. </p>
                  
                  <p>Another service, <a href="http://www.bike-on-board.ie/" target="_blank">Bike on Board</a> organises transportation of your own bike in advance of your holiday. It saves you the time of transporting your bike by ferry. </p>
                  
                  
                  <h2>Car hire</h2>
                  <p>Car hire is widely available. Visitors arriving into Dublin Airport will find <a href="http://www.hertz.ie/" target="_blank">Hertz</a>, <a href="http://www.budget.ie/" target="_blank"> Budget</a>, <a href="https://www.avis.ie" target="_blank"> Avis </a>, <a href="http://www.payless.ie/" target="_blank"> Payless Car Rental</a> and <a href="http://www.europcar.ie/" target="_blank">Europcar</a> (all of whom are based in the Arrivals Hall at Terminal 1 and the Multi-Storey Car Park at Terminal 2), as well as Dooley (based in the Arrivals Hall of Terminal 1). In addition, pre-booked car rental services are available from <a href="http://www.thrifty.com/" target="_blank">Thrifty</a>, <a href="http://www.enterprise.ie/" target="_blank">Enterprise</a> and <a href="http://www.sixt.com/car-rental/ireland" target="_blank">Sixt </a>- you'll find them in the Arrivals Hall of Terminal 1. Meet and greet services can be arranged for ferry ports in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire too.</p>
                  
                  <p> If you're unfamiliar with the city highways and byways, it's a good idea to book a Sat Nav to get your bearings (especially for visitors unfamiliar with driving on the left). If you have questions on how it all works, simply call the car rental agency before you book. They'll be delighted to help!</p>
