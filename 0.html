            <h3>Skerries</h3>
            <p>Once Ireland’s busiest fishing harbour, Skerries has a fascinating past. Visit Skerries Mills where flour has been made since the 12th century to try your hand at stone grinding. Watch the water wheel turn as it drives the machinery and go inside the five sail Great Windmill. The Skerries Heritage Trail also provides insights into the area’s history so be on the lookout for the Heritage Trail signs as you wander the town and coast. You can work up an appetite kitesurfing or sea kayaking along a string of beaches, like Skerries South Strand, before choosing a restaurant. Satisfy a seafood craving at the Blue Bar with Grilled Lobster or Gambas Pil-Pil. At Fifty4 Restaurant &amp; Pizzeria the Rockabill pizza (named after the local lighthouse) features cold-water prawns, mussels and anchovies, or choose a classic pepperoni Americana.</p>
